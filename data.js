    description: 'This project was part of <a href="https://www.chingu.io/" target="_blank" >Chingu</a> voyage 44 and was my first time working with a team. Collaborating with a group with vastly different communication styles and skillsets was equal parts challenging and fun. We utilized Agile methodology to structure the workflow. For my part, I designed the overall theme with Figma, did most of the CSS, and wrote the code for some key elements, such as the modals, the loader, and a color-coding feature. I also made smaller contributions to other parts of the project.',

    description: 'The local farmers market in my adopted hometown of Setúbal has no real web presence. I volunteered my time to build them a website where they could reach a wider customer base, as well as keep their current customers up to date. Part of this project entails not only collaborating with the farmers and vendors, but also the local government that supervises the activities of the market. The website is a work in progress, as we gain final approval from all entities involved.',

    description: 'I needed a way to help me get over the hurdle of memorizing some key aspects of vanilla JavaScript, so I created this quiz. Through creating the questions and answers, as well as writing the code, I was able to solidify my learning to that point. I styled it to mimic a retro computer screen, but added a font toggle for those who do not care for a pixelized font. Typed.js was used to run the typewriter effect.',
